# Binomial Heap

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a Binomial Heap, a data structure that supports efficient merging of heaps, insertion, and deletion of the minimum element. This implementation is specifically designed for non-negative integers and is based on exercises from a previous semester.

## Features

- **Insertion**: Insert elements with a specified key and associated information.
- **Deletion**: Efficiently delete the minimum element.
- **Find Minimum**: Retrieve the minimum element without removing it.
- **Decrease Key**: Decrease the key of a specified item and maintain heap properties.
- **Melding**: Combine two binomial heaps into one.
- **Size and Tree Count**: Obtain the number of elements and trees in the heap.

## Complexity Documentation
Each function's worst-case time complexity is documented both in the code and in a separate detailed document. Every effort has been made to achieve the lowest possible time complexity for each function.

## Output
No user output is required.
